##Ponderous Java
Java is some kind of old language which doesn't support a lot features, especially the functional programming, which makes it very heavy or ponderous sometimes, or most of the time.

While Java 8 do provide some new things that makes me refreshing. Just look at this.

<pre>
<code>
public String largestNumber(int[] num) {
  String[] ns = Arrays.stream(num)
  .mapToObj(Integer::toString)
  .sorted((x, y) -> (y + x).compareTo(x + y))
  .toArray(String[]::new);

  if ("0".equals(ns[0])) return "0";

  return String.join("", ns);
}
</code>
</pre>

Comparing to Python version:

<pre>
<code>
class Solution:
  # @param num, a list of integers
  # @return a string
  def largestNumber(self, num):
    num = sorted([str(x) for x in num], cmp = self.compare)
    ans = ''.join(num).lstrip('0')
    return ans or '0'

  def compare(self, a, b):
    return [1, -1][a + b > b + a]
</code>
</pre>

Not that ponderous, even a bit more clear, right?

##Tutorial

There are some good articles introducing the new features. Among them, I found [those](https://github.com/winterbe/java8-tutorial) provided by [winterbe](https://github.com/winterbe) most helpful, easy to understand and well rounded.

* Extension Methods
* Lambda expressions
* Functional Interfaces
* Method and Constructor References
* Streams
* Date API
* Annotations

And he also introduced Nashorn and Backbone.js.
