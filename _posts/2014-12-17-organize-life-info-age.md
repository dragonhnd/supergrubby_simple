Information, time and capital are the three most important element of this age. But, it all belongs to someone and serves someone. In other words, we, the human being, are the core. We organize information, plan time and manage capital all for our life.

##Information
The way we process information can be summarized as a Read - Understand(Evaluate) - Process - Memory - Act Loop. We need well control each step carefully, or  once we get used to a wrong way, we will find hard to learn or understand or judge things.

###1. Read
We should learn to choose what we read everyday and manage the source. Useless or biased information will only mislead the way we look at and think about things. Timeliness, accuracy, the reading load, focusing point are all important. We need develop a habit and reflect it periodically.

1. I read from Weibo and Weixin most. this apparently is a bad behavior since the information's timeliness is very short and the purpose of reading is causal. I need to read from those SNS daily but should not spend too much time on it.
2. I read books of different kinds, most of them just for a moment of fun. Though happy reading is right, I must find a way to rasie the quality.

**Evernote, websites, blogs and sns(Weixin, weibo, twitter), books(Douban), Pocket**

###2. Evaluate
Most people have trouble in evaluating scenarios, either underestimated or exaggerated. We learn it from experience both from ourselves and others. By saying one self's experience, it depends on his ability to summarize what has happened and find rules of it. As for other's experience, we can get it from the book, the words. So it's important to keep mind open and stay hungry to read and learn.

**note, blogs, books, TED, community activity, talk with the elder**

###3. Process
I give different level of priority after evaluation.
0. Best practice
1. Learn deeply
2. Know well
2. Get basic concept
3. Just know
4. Ignore

**my website, micro blog, my github, notes, xmind**

###4. Memory
The memory part comes after the process.
1. make it a complete product
2. share with others with a prototype
3. write a paper based on a conceptual prototype
4. write a article about the concept
5. fast read and shallow memory

**portfolio, paper & article, gitpage**

###5. Act
Based on what we learn and what we know, we can make detailed plan and organize our time.

**Todoist, dodol memo, google calendar**

##Time
Time is limited and not all time can be used efficiently, we must commit that some time are destined to be occupied by some affairs.

What I can to do is make a plan. It should not be very detailed since it will be horrible given everything settled. It should cover the basic direction and with details when necessary.

**Todoist, google calendar**

Besides, I use IFTTT to link all these channels.
