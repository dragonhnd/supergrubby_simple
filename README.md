This is my personal website.

And it's built up on a project of [nickbalestra](http://nick.balestra.ch/2015/Kactus/).


## Thanks
Most of the work has been already done by the [Cactus for mac authors](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/blob/master/AUTHORS), Nick has ported their default theme to Jekyll.
Nick has also added few things specific to Jekyll and some minor style changes.
